## Eating for performance

If you are thinking of increasing your physical activity it is important to ensure you have enough fuel for the activities that you will undertake. When you exercise your body needs to increase the amount of energy being produced, your muscles contract more strenuously, heart beat increases and lungs work harder. All this requires energy.

The three components of food that are capable of producing energy are carbohydrate, protein and fat.

Carbohydrate sources are mainly used for energy, proteins are used for emergencies or when carbohydrates amounts are lower in the body. So, to ensure you have sufficient energy for the activity ensure that your diet has increased amounts of CHO (potatoes, pasta) and protein (animal/meat products, poultry, cheese, lentils, yoghurt). Cut down on fat and fatty foods. Drink plenty of fluid throughout the day (8 glasses of water is the recommended amount per day) and drink before, during and after exercise.

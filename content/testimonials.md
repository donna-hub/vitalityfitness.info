> I can’t thank Donna enough – after 20 sessions I’m fitter than I have been for years and one and a half stones lighter! Donna made the sessions fun and is excellent at motivating you to work that little bit harder. I even began looking forward to them! Don’t think it’s too late to get fit – at almost 70 I feel better than I did at 50! Thank you Donna!

> I really appreciated Donna’s friendly but firm approach; she showed commitment to helping me achieve my goals even when I was struggling to keep motivated. As well as seeing great results in terms of weight loss and core strength, I’ve really noticed the benefit for my concentration and mental agility as I study for a postgrad degree in my spare time. Would definitely recommend.

> Donna helped me to start getting fitter and to understand types of exercise that are beneficial to me.I have already recommended Vitality Fitness to friends both for PT and sports massage, due to the benefits I have seen from both as well as Donna’s professional, friendly and helpful manner.

> I particularly enjoyed the running speed training sessions, and I enjoyed the personal training sessions with Donna; as both types of session were always challenging, but also rewarding as I always felt afterwards that I had pushed myself and had achieved something.

> I was able to build up my fitness level and lose weight. I feel better about myself and my body. I loved the boxing and the boxercise classes. I enjoyed the running sessions we had but I loved that our sessions were always varied and interesting and adapted the fitter we got.

> Donna is friendly but firm and is determined to get the best out of you. An excellent and reasonably priced service with the added benefits of a personalised gym programme for those times she can’t be with you, an all rounder!

> I would rate my overall experience of Donna of Vitality Fitness of 5 out of 5! She had an outstanding knowledge of physical fitness coupled with an excellent teaching manner. Donna is 100% commited to helping others achieve their goals and I find her very motivating. I feel a lot fitter since completing personal training with Vitality Fitness and feel a lot more focused about my exercise regime and know what I am capable of! Donna provides a prompt, professional, friendly service and I was extremely pleased with the exercise programme she created for me. Donna really listens to what you want to achieve out of the personal training sessions. I would whole-heartedly recommend Donna from Vitality Fitness to others.

> I found Donna to be friendly and fun. She had a great ability to adapt my training to my fitness level and provide the best training for my goals. At all times she was oustandingly motivational due to her enthuiasm for what she does! I feel a lot fitter than I have for a very long time and this is down to Donna. I really enjoyed the rowing parts of the training, as as an ex rower this was key to my interest in training. The boxing was great exercise and great fun! Donna got me motivated again and allowed me to find motivation to train again!

I found she was very motivational and able to demonstrate and had a great skill in teaching the correct exercise technique. My motivation and fitness has improved wholeheartedly and would recommend Vitality Fitness to others. Donna’s diverse sessions were very effective and enjoyable.

> Donna has provided the motivation to change my routine to allow me to lead a healthy lifestlye. I really liked the one to one training sessions as I felt that I gained so much more within the hour than I would have done in a class. Donna has excellent teaching skills and is very professional. I am confident in a gym now and look forward to training!
